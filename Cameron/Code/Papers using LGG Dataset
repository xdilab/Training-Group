Achieved 94.36 dice score and 91.83 IOU score
Utilized DeepLabv3 architecture, RegNet as image encoder, used Dice loss for loss function
“DeepLabv3+ (19) requires only fusion of the bottom- and top-level features and is significantly less redundant than conventional cross-layer connected segmentation algorithms. Therefore, a combination of RegNet and DeepLabv3+ can be expected to yield a less redundant structure and superior network-structure parameters than manually designed networks.”
