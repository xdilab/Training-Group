* Convolution is Core operation in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
    * Used to detect features in images, such as edges or patterns.
* Analogy:
    * Imagine finding the outlines of buildings and people in a city image.
    * Convolution helps identify these features systematically.
Convolution process
    1. A filter (small grid with specific numbers) is used.
    2. The filter slides over the image (a process called scanning).
    3. At each position, the filter:
        * Multiplies its numbers with the corresponding image region.
        * Adds up the results (a dot product).
    * Creates a new image (feature map) that highlights specific features detected by the filter.
    * Example: A filter for vertical edges will output an image showing vertical edge locations.
    * Helps the computer focus on important features for tasks like image classification or object detection.

Padding - Adding extra pixels to to an image before convolution to ensure the output matches the input size. Adding zeroes around edges, or mirrior image at the boundaries

Strided Convolution - Filter moves more than one pixel at a time - > reduces output size but still captures important features -> One word at a time vs Two words

Convolutional Layer -  Filters detect texture or edges -> creates smaller version of image with features highlighted -> Adds bias to highlighted features -> applies non linear function to help features stand out more

Pooling Layers - Reduce size of feature map while retaining important features
Reduces computation.
Controls overfitting by making the network invariant to small translations in the image.


* Max Pooling: Takes the maximum value from each pooling window.
* Average Pooling: Computes the average value of the pooling window.
* Global Pooling: Reduces the feature map to a single value (per channel).
