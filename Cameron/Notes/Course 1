Neural Networks - Learn to predict outcomes based on input data
Ex: predicting house price based on 
features like size + number of bedrooms
Neuron -> Takes input and outputs prediction 
Large neural networks -> Created by stacking multiple neurons together 
Each neuron can take all input features allowing for network to learn intricate relationships 
Rectified Linear Unit (RLU) - Starts at zero instead of going negative

Train neural network by providing dataset with input output pairs -> network learns to map inputs to outputs

Standard Neural Networks -> best for structured data
Convolutional neural networks -> best for image data
Recurrent neural networks - > for sequence data like audio and language
Additionally there are hybrid architectures

Structured vs. Unstructured Data
* Structured data consists of well-defined features, like databases used in housing price prediction
* unstructured data includes images, audio, and text, which are more challenging for computers to interpret.

Size of neural networks and scale are important
* Larger neural networks can achieve higher performance levels, especially when trained on substantial amounts of labeled data.
MORE DATA IS ALMOST ALWAYS BENEFCIAL
