Object localization - looking for one item 
Object detection - detecting multiple items and classifying them
Yolo - you only look once 
Utilizes a single pass
Image divided into a grid and each cell predicts a bounding box
Takes bounding box and determines class

Anchor boxes - predefined bounding boxes assigned to each cell
Boxes are shifted and adjusted to detect objects for classification 

Non max suppression - reduces redundant boxes. Takes higher confidence level predictions
Intersection over union - if greater than specified value the box is removed 

Skip connections - connects output of one layer to input of another layer

Face detection - detects faces but doesn’t necessarily them
Face recognition - recognizes faces and connects them to know identities 

Converts facial features into high dimensional vectors, if values are aligned to a certain threshold the faces are the same.

One shot learning - taking very small samples of data and training models to detect or classify based on these samples

Siamese networks - measure how similar two inputs are
takes two identical cnn’s
Converts images into feature vectors
Measures how close two vectors are, if below a certain threshold the faces match.

Semantic segmentation - classifies all the pixels regarding each object

U net - Encoder uses cnn’s to downscale images and extract features, deep representations
